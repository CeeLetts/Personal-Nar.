<h1 class="header">Chelsea's Web Design Journey (or struggle)</h1>

<p class="body">Once upon a time, there was a girl named Chelsea.  She decided to take a web design course because she managed the Student Union Board's wordpress account, which she quickly realized was drastically different...</p>

<p class="body">There is no denying that this was a difficult class for me.  I was very overwhelmed and frustrated for about 80% of the class.  I definitely felt like I was at a disadvantage for not having a MAC computer so borrowing my grandmoms for the end of the semester was helpful.  It was definitely an interesting topic but not something that I think I had the skill set before.  I've never dealt with the fear of thinking you may fail a class until this semester, fingers crossed I don't!</p>

<p class="body">With that being said I am very proud of my website and actually satisified with how it came out.  I know it is no where near as sophisticated and complex as the rest of the class but I am okay with that.  For how much doubt I had in myself and this website project I would say the outcome is legitimately a miracle!  I believe you said in the beginning of class that our website by the end might look like an XANGA, and yes mine sort of does, but <strong>IT'S MY SIMPLE XANGA-ESQUE WEBSITE AND I LOVE IT </strong>. The result of my project is to the best of my abilities.  I had a lot of ideas of how I wanted my website to look and a lot of it was just a little to complicated for me, but again like I said, I am proud of my finished project.</p>

<p class="body">This was a difficult semester for me with trying to juggle my senior thesis project and having an internship so I admit I may not have allocated enough time and attention to this class but I gave it as much as I felt I could.  Please know that I tried very hard and that my simplistic website isn't due to lack of effort.  Enjoy my website and go easy on me please!</p>
